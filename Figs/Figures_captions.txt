1. Comparison GD vs QNGD
- The figure compares the performance of GD and QNGD in finding the ground state of the Pauli-X matrix. 
- QNGD escapes saddle points and reaches the global minimum more efficiently than GD.

2. Overview of the Quantum Learning Model
- The quantum learning model consists of input quantum data (associated with classical labels) that are processed using a parameterized quantum circuit, followed by a POVM to predict labels. The model aims to find an optimal parameter
by minimizing the average per-sample expected loss.

3. Performance of the proposed 2-QNSCD algorithm
- The figure consists of plots of 2-QNSCD convergence for 3, 4, 5, and 6 qubits. 
- The results demonstrate that 2-QNSCD achieves faster convergence and demonstrates the ability to avoid saddle points and/or local minima.

4. 2-Qubit synthetic dataset
- The figure depicts the synthetic dataset used in the paper for the 2 qubits case.
